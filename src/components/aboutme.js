            <p>In various project classes I took in my undergrad, I experienced working as Software developer, I was involved with project research, planning, design and testing within the Software Product Development. Through innovative thinking I used computer aided devices to perform routine calculations creating an efficient project development time line. During the design stage I met with the client provided by my professors to better understand their needs and perspectives. As I became more familiar with the needs of different kinds of clientele I suggested, implemented and maintained test procedures and test scripts for new products. I am graduating with a Bachelor of Computer Science with Mathâ€™s minor from Southeastern Louisiana University. My solid knowledge of computer software design and project development has given me the foundation to succeed in the software engineering industry. During my program I became interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as its implementation on average consumers efficiency</p>
